# PHP Project

This repository contains a PHP project that demonstrates various PHP programming concepts and best practices.

## Description

This project is a simple Library Management System designed to help libraries manage their collection of books and members efficiently. The system allows library staff to add new books and members, lend books to members, and process book returns. It also provides features to list available and borrowed books, as well as display registered members.

**Key Features:**

- Add new books to the library with details such as title, author, and ISBN.
- Register new members with unique member IDs and names.
- Lend books to members and track which books are currently borrowed.
- Process book returns and update book availability.
- List all available books that can be borrowed.
- List all borrowed books and their current status.
- Display all registered library members.
- Interactive command-line interface for easy management.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in PHP, including classes for books, members, and the library itself, as well as basic input/output operations for user interaction.
